PayEZ Pay - Digital Wallet & FinTech App (Flutter)

PayEZ Pay is a portfolio-focused mobile application built with Flutter, simulating a modern digital wallet and bill payment service. The project was developed as a case study to demonstrate core skills in mobile development, backend integration, and state management, specifically targeting the booming FinTech sector in Egypt and the wider MENA region.

‚ú® Core Features

Secure User Authentication: Full email & password sign-up and login flow using Firebase Authentication.

Real-time Dashboard: A dynamic home screen that displays the user's current balance and personal information, updated instantly from Firestore.

Live Transaction History: The user's balance and transaction list update in real-time without needing a manual refresh, powered by Firestore Streams.

Wallet Top-Up: A simulated feature allowing users to add funds to their wallet, demonstrating secure balance update logic.

Bill Payments: A core FinTech feature where users can pay for mock services, with transactions only succeeding if the wallet balance is sufficient.

Profile & Settings Management: Users can manage their profile, change their password, and log out securely.

Localization (i18n): The app supports multiple languages (English & Arabic) using Flutter's l10n package.

Dynamic Theming: Users can switch between a clean Light Mode and a sleek Dark Mode.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

This project was built with a modern, scalable, and professional tech stack.

Framework: Flutter

Backend: Google Firebase (Authentication & Firestore Database)

State Management:  Cubit / Riverpod for predictable and decoupled state logic.

Architecture:

Feature-First Structure: Code is organized by feature (e.g., home, profile, auth) for maintainability.

Auth Gate Pattern: A central AuthGate widget listens to the global authentication state to securely direct users to either the login screen or the main app.

Service Layer: A dedicated service (FirestoreService) handles all communication with the backend, separating business logic from the UI.

Internationalization: Flutter Localization (l10n).

Routing: MaterialPageRoute for clear and simple navigation.

flutter run



üìù Project Development Journey

This project was built following a structured development plan, moving through distinct phases from ideation to deployment.

Phase 0: Foundation & Planning: The project started with a clear PRD (Product Requirements Document), wireframes, and a development timeline. The Flutter project and Firebase backend were set up.

Phase 1: UI Shell & Models: All screens were built statically based on the wireframes, and the data models (UserModel, TransactionModel) were created to support the UI without logic.

Phase 2: Authentication: Firebase Authentication was integrated to build a fully functional and secure login/registration system, protected by the "Auth Gate" architecture.

Phase 3: Core FinTech Logic: The heart of the application was built using a FirestoreService and secure Firestore Transactions to handle balance updates and bill payments atomically and safely.

Phase 4: Polishing & Final Touches: The final phase involved adding localization, dynamic theming, error handling, loading indicators, and writing this comprehensive README to prepare the project for a professional portfolio.

This structured approach ensured a high-quality, maintainable, and robust final product.
